Math Stuff
This program does some math computations based on user-inputed integers. The program will determine if the first integer inputed
is prime or not. For the second number it will list all prime integers between 1 and the input. For the third number the program
will compute the Fibonacci Sequence value of the inputed term. For the final number, the program will compute and list all of that
integers prime factors, or tell you if the number inputed is prime.
